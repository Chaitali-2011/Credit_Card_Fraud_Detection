Credit card fraud is a serious problem that affects financial institutions and their customers worldwide. With fraudsters becoming increasingly sophisticated in their methods, financial institutions require advanced tools to detect and prevent fraud. Machine learning algorithms have shown great promise in detecting and preventing credit card fraud.

I have developed a Python-based machine learning system using Matplotlib, Scikit-learn libraries & Flask framework to detect fraudulent transactions from credit card data up to a million transactions per minute. 
The credit card fraud detection system employs various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, XGBoost, and neural networks, to analyze a dataset of credit card transactions labeled as fraudulent or legitimate. 
These algorithms collectively enhance fraud detection by identifying intricate patterns and anomalies within transaction data. Logistic regression models transaction probability based on input features, while decision trees and random forests create decision-based models. 
XGBoost employs sequential decision trees to enhance accuracy, handling missing data and large datasets. 
This multi-algorithm approach empowers financial institutions to significantly improve fraud prevention, safeguarding customers from fraudulent activities through efficient data analysis.

Enhanced performance accuracy by 28% & reduced system error incidence by conducting  comprehensive data analysis, statistics pre-processing.
Defined key features to be extracted & transformed from the raw data (Feature engineering) to optimize training & predictions of legitimacy of the transactions.
Formulated & applied machine learning algorithms on transactional data to improve fraud flagging processes.
Generated graphical reports via visualization tools like Power-Bi & Tableau for fraud patterns predicted.
